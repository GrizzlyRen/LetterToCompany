> Hello Developers :
Thank you for reading this letter, I want to tell you something disastrous, suffering about poor employees.  
We are just ordinary young man, struggle for our survival and work hard, we don't wanna put ourselves in any trouble, work and pay is our whole life. Unfortunately, we join a fraudulent company, the liar tells us: If you work hard, you will get ample reward, including nice vehicle or villa, we work more than 10 hours a day without any extra pay, even conferencing every weekend.  
In our culture, every time we work on the weekend, the employer should treat employees or send presents more or less. But, we have nothing except complaints, the employer told us that we can't finish functions in a very short time frequently. Extremely, the work plan is drawn up by an employer, but the dummy always scraps it, says we must finish all plan when he notices it and doesn't according to the plan. Why???  
After finishing the project, the dummy did a stupid thing, he fired all employees, exactly us, and threaten us that he doesn't pay off because the project is used to pornographic applications for escaping information.  
In conclusion, maybe we decided to publish all source code including the signature file. We clearly understand this behavior is unethical, but we have no choice.
P.S: If you cannot contact me long time, it's no doubt that I got retaliation. Call the police can help me.
